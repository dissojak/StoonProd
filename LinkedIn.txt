My LinkedIn account has been hacked, starting with unauthorized access to my email (ademadembenamor@hotmail.com
). The hacker changed my profile name from Adem Ben Amor to Wei Zhang. My original name was Adem Ben Amor, sometimes with the nickname Dissojak.

Even though Iâ€™ve recovered my email, I cannot access my LinkedIn account, which remains locked in the identity verification process. This situation has been ongoing for far too long and is severely affecting me professionally. I urgently request immediate action to restore my original account.

Profile email: ademadembenamor@hotmail.com
Profile GitHub: github.com/dissojak
Profile URL: linkedin.com/adem_ben_amor

To verify my identity, I will attach:
My previous professional LinkedIn photo
My GitHub profile
My Tunisian national ID

Additional verification: 
I am actively committing to my GitHub projects.
As I send this report, I will make a new commit in my repo (github.com/dissojak/stoonprod) containing this exact message in a text file named linkedin.txt.
This commit serves as proof that I am the rightful owner of the account.
You can check the commit to confirm my identity.
